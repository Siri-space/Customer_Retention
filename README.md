KEYWORDS

Customer retention refers to the rate at which customers stay with a business in a given period.
Customer retention refers to a company's ability to turn customers into repeat buyers and prevent them from switching to a competitor.
Churn is a measurement of the percentage of accounts that cancel or choose not to renew their subscriptions.

OBJECTIVE
This project aims to clean, wrangle, and visualize data to help a hypothetical telecom company "Phone Now" understand its customers and employees better.
This part of the project was to create a dashboard using the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights.

SITUATION

•	The sales manager of our telecom client advised that there was a decline in customer retention and an increase in churn rates over the last 2 quarters, and the sales team needed insights to understand the cause of the issue as customers are hard-earned. They do not want to lose them.
•	The previous approach was to get in touch with customers after they have terminated their phone or internet service contract, they want to be proactive to see potential customers at risk of leaving.
•	Overview of trends in customer and agent behavior on a dashboard for managers.

HOW I ACHIEVED THE RESULTS

•	Define proper KPIs – Business aligned, measurable, realistic, and actionable.
•	Insights on Customers and call agents to understand them better.
•	Customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls.
•	Insights on churn rate and customer retention.

ACTIONS TAKEN

•	Clearly defined the objectives and asked questions my analysis will answer.
•	Understand the timeline for the project.
•	Gathered relevant data from sources: Sales data from CRM (customer demographics, customer account information, call history) and agent data from the HR database.
•	Cleaned, transformed, and formatted the data using Excel formulas.
•	I executed SQL queries to join and analyze the sales, customer, and Agent data.
•	Imported to Power BI to identify patterns and correlations.
•	Understood my target audience, and used simple combinations of visualizations, including charts and graphs, to illustrate key metrics and KPIs and did a demo of this dashboard.
•	I presented the findings to stakeholders using PowerPoint and graphs extracted from Power BI outlining key insights.

RESULTS
•	Based on the analysis and dashboard, they could see the trends in:
•	Speed to respond to calls by each agent.
•	Calls answered/canceled and speed to resolve tickets at customer and agent level.
•	Get the performance of agents over time and monitor future performance.
•	Customer churn rate within specific regions, contract types, and services that customers signed up for.
•	Using the dashboard, managers will be able to monitor trends and see potential customers at risk of leaving.

RECOMMENDATIONS

•	Identify agents with slower response times or lower resolution speeds and provide targeted training programs to improve the skills of underperforming agents.
•	Recognize and reward high-performing agents to boost morale and motivation.
•	Implement measures to enhance the speed of response to customer calls.
•	Monitor and optimize the call-to-resolution process to minimize cancellations.
•	Encourage agents to resolve tickets efficiently without compromising quality.
•	Leverage insights on customer churn rates within specific regions, contract types, and services and tailor sales strategies for different customer segments based on identified trends.
•	Use the dashboard to proactively identify potential churn risks and implement customer engagement programs to address issues before they lead to churn.
•	Offer promotions or bundles to incentivize customers to expand their contracts.
•	Implement targeted marketing and retention efforts in regions with higher churn.
•	Encourage regular monitoring of the dashboard for real-time insights.
